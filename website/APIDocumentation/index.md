Infinity is a LuaU game framework designed for the Roblox Engine! 
Infinity's purpose is to define structure and speed up development inside of your experiences. 

This framework takes in both ECS and OOP principles, Infinity itself using these paradigm to construct an advanced framework.
Infinity offers things such as state management, simplistic network libaries, classes and so on. 

Infinity is also used in Plugin Development as well, this framework covers all Roblox contexts. 
If you encounter problems with Infinity, you can let me know below!

!!! Warning
    Infinity is still in it's early stages. 
    I'd avoid using this system in advanced projects.
