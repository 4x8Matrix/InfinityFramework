Infinity is a LuaU [object orientated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) framework & libary, Designed to simplify and Speed the development of an Experience up!
I personally use Infinity for all my private & public projects, so if you do come across a problem, it would be awesome if you
[open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/4x8Matrix/InfinityFramework/issues).

--------------------------------

## Classes
The infinity classes, these are a selection of [userdata](https://www.lua.org/pil/28.1.html) objects which you can call and reference properties from, these userdata objects are composed of unique methods which should help you modularize your programming.

Each class is unique in their task and what they must achieve, however, to use a class you must :Extend from one of the class objects, in no case should you ever create or deploy your own Infinity Class as it might not have support for it. 

--------------------------------

## Libaries
Infinity offers a Bucket-Load of Libaries, which you can access via the Infinity Object! These libaries cover things such as, Perlin Worm Libaries, to important table utility functions like DeepClone. 

We also use a Net Libary that is built into the fundementals of Infinity Classes, This Net libary is used to send and recieve data with very little instance-manipulation involved. 

There's alot of awesome libaries to go over, but i'll let you go over them in your own time.
