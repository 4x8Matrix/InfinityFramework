# Infinity 2.0
Infinity 2.0 will be the foundations for a complicated system; Allowing you to define a structure to your codebase.
Infinity 2.0 will rely heavily on the ideals, technology that Infinity 1.0 had, however adapting to be light on the systems it's used on.

## Components
A component is an object used internally & externally by Infinity, a component will consist of properties, private & public methods and so fourth. 
A component will consist of one important table which will not be writable; `Private` 

This `Private` table is a table full of private methods & properties you will only be used by the component itself, from an external point; Accessing these
properties will result in either an assertion error, or a nil value. 

## Services
A Service is a special server component, this component holds un-writable tables such as `Private`, however, a Service holds another un-writable value `Client`
Any properties, methods which are inside of this `Client` table will be replicated to any client which requires Infinity. 

Replication of this table will support **all** infinity objects, allowing you to connect to things such as Infinity Events, Hooks and so fourth.

## Libaries
Infinity Libaries will stay somewhat the same; However a few re-writes are in place to happen, maybe even so additions. 

Rewrites;

- Hook Libary, right now it's more of a light signal, we want a way to hook methods.
- Signal Libary, i'll add in more support for different variations of signals. 
- Net Libary, i'll be adding in more methods to replicate instances, for example NetworkSignals.

- Eventually more.

## Structure
The structure of Infinity will dramatically change;
The idea behind this change is to be able to recycle infinity, to destroy it live in a game and still be able to run your game, without infinity.
This is because of applications like Plugins, we need a way to remove infinity which is not only memory safe but optimized. 

Aside from that, the Infinity table, will be a component itself.
