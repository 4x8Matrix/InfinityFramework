## About
Infinity is a LuaU game framework designed for the Roblox Engine! Infinity's purpose as a game framework is to speed up the development of your Roblox-Experience, with a ton of different libaries, singletons and classes, developers can deploy advanced systems and manipulate them through Infinity easily!

This framework combines both ECS and OOP principles, The core infinity object itself uses these principles to create a reliable registry that'll allow you to access public classes and so on.

------------------------------------

## Important
Over the following next days, Infinity will undergo various updates to it's core structure. 
Infiniy right now is very heavy, containing userdatas for most of it's instances, A selection of classes which aren't needed and Infinity itself is tied to Roblox as a game engine.

Infinity will become a standalone ECS Framework, allowing you to initialize new components & services; 

The areas of Infinity tht will change will be;
- Initialization Pipeline
- Classes
- Libaries

As this is my first published framework, I now know the grey areas that I can work on. 
Things such as Infinity AntiCheat will be ported to the new version of Infinity once infinity is re-programmed.

The idea of the new system, is to be light weight, deployable in generic Lua 5.1+ and LuaU
